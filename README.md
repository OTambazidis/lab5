Archeologists of all specializations and research focuses are integrating the advancing computer vision technologies such as deep learning, 3D visualization and segmentation. Some examples of these technologies in practice are detecting and visualizing structures that are hidden beneath the earth’s surface, creating replicates of archaeological objects and identifying different types of archaeological structures. The primary goal of using these advanced technologies is to classify and visualize archeological objects and structures in multiple formats. 

In the field of archaeology, a significant amount of research is dedicated to identifying the limitations of current technologies, experimenting with computer vision analytical processes, and assessing new limitations and improvements. Fernand Cohen's "Virtual reconstruction of archaeological vessels using expert priors and intrinsic differential geometry information" highlights the tedious and time-consuming process of reconstructing unearthed objects, which is nonetheless an essential step towards further research. Integrating 3D computational and deep learning technologies to automate the visualization of the final object from its shards is an important advancement towards efficient and accurate reconstruction. Despite limitations, such as disfigurement due to erosion or incomplete inscriptions, the integration of computer vision technology in reconstruction represents a promising step forward.

While much of the focus of deep learning has been on object classification and reconstruction, researchers such as Alexandre Guyot are motivated to overcome the current limitations of technology and find innovative approaches to detection and segmentation of archaeological structures. In "Combined Detection and Segmentation of archaeological structures from lidar data using a deep learning approach," Guyot and his team integrate a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a conditional random field (CRF) model to achieve more accurate detection and segmentation of these structures. This research group has made significant progress in automating the identification of topographic anomalies and characterizing them as potential archaeological points of interest, representing a promising pathway towards automating the analysis of archaeological structures.

The results of the research not only allows archeologists to glean further information from the environment and artifacts that the human observation was not able to observe before, it is also opening up the results to the rest of the world outside the archaeological field.[Maya Arch](https://mayaarch3d.org/en/)  is a website that has built a virtual environment for recording and analyzing sites around the world. As an audience, we no longer need to physically visit another country or even a museum to marvel at our history and be able to literally see what the previous worlds looked like. 

In conclusion, the field of archaeology is experiencing unprecedented advancements due to integration of computation vision technology and GIS. With the help of these tools, researchers are uncovering new information, analyzing cross-disciplinary data and exploring previously undiscovered sites. With the embrace of these new technologies, archaeologists are able to expand the overall understanding of history and share their results with a wider audience. Through the integration of this ancient discipline with novel concepts of computer visualization, we are now able to experience and view the world of archaeology like never before. The current limitations do not reduce the promise of continued exploration in the field of archaeology. Tt will continue to bring new insights and discoveries to light for generations to come.
